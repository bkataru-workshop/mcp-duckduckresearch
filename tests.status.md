# Test Failure Report

**Objective:**
Investigate and resolve test failures in the `mcp-duckduckresearch` project.

**Current Status of Test Failures:**
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/server.test.ts` are failing with timeouts, specifically in the "Tool Execution" tests (timeout after 60 seconds).
- Unit tests in `tests/unit` are mostly passing, except for `tests/unit/utils.test.ts` which has an "Unhandled Rejection: Error: persistent failure".
- Coverage reporting initially failed with an `ENOENT` error, but this was temporarily resolved by reinstalling `@vitest/coverage-istanbul`. However, the coverage error reappeared later and was ultimately disabled for troubleshooting.

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
1. **Increased test timeout:** Increased `testTimeout` in `vitest.config.ts` to 60 seconds. (No effect on integration test timeouts)
2. **Changed coverage provider:** Switched coverage provider from "v8" to "istanbul" in `vitest.config.ts`. (No effect on integration test timeouts, coverage error behavior was inconsistent)
3. **Simplified integration test case:** Simplified the "should register all required tools" test case in `tests/integration/server.test.ts`. (No effect on integration test timeouts)
4. **Simplified `beforeEach` and `afterEach`:** Removed `mcpServer.connect` and `mcpServer.close` calls from `beforeEach` and `afterEach` in `tests/integration/server.test.ts`. (Caused "Not connected" errors, but did not resolve timeouts)
5. **Isolated integration test cases:** Commented out all test cases in `tests/integration/server.test.ts` except "Server Initialization" and "Tool Registration". (Integration tests passed without timeouts, but unit tests still failed)
6. **Re-enabled `mcpServer.connect`:** Re-enabled `mcpServer.connect` in `beforeEach` in `tests/integration/server.test.ts`. (Resolved "Not connected" errors, but timeouts returned)
7. **Disabled coverage reporting:** Completely disabled coverage reporting by removing the `coverage` section from `vitest.config.ts`. (No effect on integration test timeouts or unit test failures)
8. **Simplified `TestTransport` and added logging:** Simplified `TestTransport` class and added logging to `mockResponse` in `tests/integration/server.test.ts`. (No effect on integration test timeouts, logging shows responses are being mocked)

**Possible Root Causes (Based on Current Knowledge):**
- **Issue within `TestTransport`:** Despite simplification, there might still be subtle issues in `TestTransport` that are causing delays or deadlocks in integration tests.
- **Issue within `DuckDuckResearchServer` logic:** There might be some inefficient code or unexpected behavior in `DuckDuckResearchServer` implementation (`src/index.ts`) that is causing delays, even with mocked dependencies.
- **Issue within `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js`:** The `Server.request` or `Server.connect` methods in the MCP SDK might have performance bottlenecks or unexpected behavior when used with `TestTransport` or in the test environment.
- **Environment-specific factors:** There might be some resource contention, system configuration, or other environment-specific factors on the user's machine that are causing the tests to run slowly and time out.
- **Unhandled Promise Rejection in Unit Tests:** The persistent "Unhandled Rejection: Error: persistent failure" in `tests/unit/utils.test.ts` might be a separate issue, but it's worth investigating as it could be related to the overall test instability.

**Next Actions:**
- Continue thorough examination of `TestTransport` for subtle implementation issues.
- Conduct a detailed review of `DuckDuckResearchServer` logic in `src/index.ts`, focusing on potential performance bottlenecks in `CallToolRequestSchema` handler.
- Investigate the source code of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js` (if available) to understand `Server.request` and `Server.connect` implementations and identify potential SDK-related issues.
- Add more logging to `DuckDuckResearchServer` in `src/index.ts` to trace the request handling flow and measure execution times of different operations.
- Investigate the "Unhandled Rejection" error in `tests/unit/utils.test.ts` to rule out any potential impact on overall test stability.

**Conclusion:**
The root cause of the integration test timeouts remains unclear despite extensive troubleshooting. Further investigation is needed, focusing on the interaction between the test setup, mock transport, server implementation, and the MCP SDK. The next steps will involve deeper code analysis and targeted logging to pinpoint the source of the performance issues.
